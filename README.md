# Advent of Code

Advent of code is a 25 day coding challenge [link](https://adventofcode.com/).

This repo provides my implementations

## 2020

In 2020, I chose to sovle the challenges in Python. Run with `python $FILE`, for example `python 2020/01_finance.py`

## 2021

In 2021, I chose to solve the challenges in Golang and Rust.

Run with `rustc 2021/day_X/main.rs && ./main` for rust, and `go run 2021/day_X/main.go` for golang

Compare performance with `DAY="9"; rustc "2021/day_$DAY/main.rs"; ./main; go run "2021/day_$DAY/main.go"`


## 2023

In 2023 I chose to solves the challenges in good old Python.
I copied the utils from 2022, as well as the structure (`main.py`, `test_main.py`)

Run with `python aoc_2023.day_X.main` or with `PYTHONPATH=./ python aoc_2023/day_X/main.py`
